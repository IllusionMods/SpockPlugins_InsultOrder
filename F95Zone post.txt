Hey guys, I've been translating IO for a while and just saw this project TODAY! So I kinda redone some things without knowing, sorry... Is it possible that we join forces?

For those who don't know me, I was in translation team for Honey Select 2 and Koikatsu Sunshine, and also helped a little in Honey Select 1 on old Hongfire days...

Unfortunatelly I have no idea how to Trello. @Toweke, @m4nime where are the files, how can I edit them?

Like illusion games translations, I'm using GitHub for the translation project. This way you can just edit the file you want! Feel free to edit the files with your translations: https://github.com/SpockBauru/IO_Translation

I'm organizing in different files instead of putting everything in AutoTranslations, the goal is to not have anything autotranslated so is easier to edit.

I didn't understand how you guys organized the manual ADV Translation, so please anyone can tell me how to know what is machine and what is human translations? I'll put all human translations in the file ADV_ManualTranslations.txt, and let the machine translations in zz_MachineTranslation.txt

I'm also updating older plugins to BepInEx 5.4, and using the new xUnityAutotranslator. It will take some time to modernize all plugins, you can check what is done already:
